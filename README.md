CS 425 Final Project

To compile/execute/debug the PL/SQL statements:
- First enable the dbms output window by going to view -> dbms output
- Then, in the dbms output window click the plus sign to connect to the database, click ok
- When you run a DBMS_OUTPUT.PUTLINE('-----'); statement, you will see output in the DBMS output window

- You can simply compile a PL/SQL procedure by highlighting the create or replace procedure then clicking the green arrow
- To run the program, highlight the EXECUTE <procedure>; statement and click the green arrow to run it. The program first has to be compiled before execution.
